    "The motivation for commencing the H.Dip programme was to determine how to merge datasets with a common linking key/index e.g. student ID, and conduct analysis on this merged dataset, as this reflects the analysis carried out in my everyday research (medical education in an Irish postgraduate medical training body). Previously, a statistician was employed to assist with this work as the volumes of data were too large conventional stats packages, and ever since I have wanted to be able to do this myself, to allow me to complete all stages of my research myself, from planning, execution, data gathering and analysis.  \n",
    "Therefore, this project aims to simulate a student outcomes research project, including the merging of data by key identifier, the use of SQL database to hold the data, analysis through python packages and presentation through similar. \n",

To enable matching, student ids were replaced from #1 to 5000 and #1 to 10000, respectively. The other steps required for data clean-up could be completed in pandas"
